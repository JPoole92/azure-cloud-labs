# Azure Projects – Portfolio Overview

This section documents my **hands-on Azure projects**, built to demonstrate practical skills required for **Cloud Support**, **Systems Administrator**, and **Azure Administrator (AZ-104)** roles.

Each project is treated as a **real-world lab**, with clear objectives, step-by-step configuration, screenshots, and lessons learned. Projects are completed primarily through the **Azure Portal**, with later projects incorporating **PowerShell**, **Azure CLI**, and **Infrastructure as Code**.

> ⚠️ Links to individual project folders will be added once each project is fully completed and documented.
