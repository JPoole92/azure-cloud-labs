Project Level

Novice (Beginner-friendly, Azure Portal only)

This project is designed as an entry-level, step-by-step Azure Portal lab focused on identity management fundamentals using Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure Active Directory). It assumes no prior Azure administration experience.

Project Objective

Demonstrate the ability to:

Create and manage an Azure AD (Entra ID) tenant

Create and configure Azure AD users

Create Azure AD groups with assigned and dynamic membership

Invite and manage guest (B2B) users

This project reflects real-world tasks performed by Cloud Support and Junior Systems Administrators.

Step-by-Step Deployment & Configuration
Step 1: Verify or Create an Entra ID Tenant

Objective: Ensure an Entra ID tenant exists for identity management.

Steps:

Sign in to the Azure Portal

Search for Microsoft Entra ID

Review the Overview page to confirm a tenant exists

Optional (Create New Tenant):

Microsoft Entra ID → Manage tenants → Create

Tenant type: Microsoft Entra ID

Provide:

Organization name

Initial domain name

Region

Review + Create

Expected Outcome:

Entra ID tenant is active and accessible

Step 2: Create Azure AD Users

Objective: Create internal users with realistic attributes.

Steps:

Microsoft Entra ID → Users → New user → Create new user

Create at least 3 users, for example:

admin.user

it.support

hr.employee

Configure:

Display name

Username

Job title

Department

Usage location

Save generated passwords securely

Expected Outcome:

Users appear in the Users list

Step 3: Create a Security Group (Assigned Membership)

Objective: Demonstrate manual group-based access control.

Steps:

Microsoft Entra ID → Groups → New group

Group type: Security

Group name: IT-Assigned-SG

Membership type: Assigned

Add one or more users manually

Expected Outcome:

Selected users are members of the group

Step 4: Create a Security Group (Dynamic Membership)

Objective: Demonstrate rule-based group membership.

Steps:

Microsoft Entra ID → Groups → New group

Group type: Security

Group name: IT-Dynamic-SG

Membership type: Dynamic User

Add rule:

(user.department -eq "IT")

Validate and save

Expected Outcome:

Users with Department = IT are automatically added

Step 5: Manage Azure AD Guest Users (B2B)

Objective: Invite and manage an external user.

Steps:

Microsoft Entra ID → Users → New user → Invite external user

Enter a valid external email address

Send invitation

Assign guest user to a security group

Expected Outcome:

Guest user listed with User Type = Guest

Security & Best Practices

Use groups instead of direct user permissions

Apply least privilege access

Separate admin and standard users

Use dynamic groups for scalability

Lessons Learned

Dynamic groups rely on accurate user attributes

Guest users have limited default permissions

Tenant context switching can be confusing for beginners
