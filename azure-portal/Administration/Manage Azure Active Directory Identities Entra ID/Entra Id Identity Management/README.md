# Azure Project: Manage Azure Active Directory (Microsoft Entra ID) Identities

## Project Level

**Novice | Azure Portal Only**

This project is a beginner-friendly, step-by-step implementation of **Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure Active Directory)** identity management using the **Azure Portal**. It is designed for individuals transitioning into **Cloud Support**, **Junior Systems Administrator**, or **Azure Administrator** roles.

The goal is to demonstrate foundational identity and access management skills in a clear, repeatable, and well-documented manner.

---

## Project Objectives

By completing this project, you will demonstrate the ability to:

* Create and manage an Azure AD (Entra ID) tenant
* Create and configure internal Azure AD users
* Create Azure AD security groups with **assigned** and **dynamic** membership
* Invite and manage **guest (B2B)** users

---

## Skills Demonstrated

* Identity and Access Management (IAM)
* Microsoft Entra ID administration
* Azure Portal navigation
* User and group lifecycle management
* Entry-level cloud security best practices

---

## Environment & Tools

* Microsoft Azure Portal
* Microsoft Entra ID (Azure Active Directory)
* Azure Free Tier Subscription

---

## Logical Architecture Overview

* Azure Subscription
* Microsoft Entra ID Tenant
* Internal Users
* Security Groups (Assigned & Dynamic)
* External Guest User (B2B)

---

## Step-by-Step Implementation

### Step 1: Verify or Create a Microsoft Entra ID Tenant

**Objective:** Ensure an Entra ID tenant exists and is associated with your Azure subscription.

**Steps:**

1. Sign in to the Azure Portal
2. Search for **Microsoft Entra ID**
3. Review the **Overview** blade to confirm a tenant is present

**Optional – Create a New Tenant:**

1. Microsoft Entra ID → Manage tenants → Create
2. Tenant type: **Microsoft Entra ID**
3. Provide:

   * Organization name
   * Initial domain name
   * Region
4. Review + Create

**Expected Result:**

* Entra ID tenant is active and accessible

### Step 2: Create Azure AD Users

**Objective:** Create internal users with realistic enterprise attributes.

**Steps:**

1. Microsoft Entra ID → Users → New user → Create new user
2. Create at least **three users**, for example:

   * `admin.user`
   * `it.support`
   * `hr.employee`
3. Configure the following properties:

   * Display name
   * Username
   * Job title
   * Department
   * Usage location
4. Save the autogenerated passwords securely

**Expected Result:**

* Users appear in the Users list and can be managed

### Step 3: Create a Security Group (Assigned Membership)

**Objective:** Demonstrate manual, group-based access management.

**Steps:**

1. Microsoft Entra ID → Groups → New group
2. Group type: **Security**
3. Group name: `IT-Assigned-SG`
4. Membership type: **Assigned**
5. Manually add one or more users

**Expected Result:**

* Selected users are explicitly assigned to the group

### Step 4: Create a Security Group (Dynamic Membership)

**Objective:** Demonstrate rule-based group membership using user attributes.

**Steps:**

1. Microsoft Entra ID → Groups → New group
2. Group type: **Security**
3. Group name: `IT-Dynamic-SG`
4. Membership type: **Dynamic User**
5. Add the following rule:

   ```
   (user.department -eq "IT")
   ```
6. Validate and save the rule

**Expected Result:**

* Users with Department set to IT are automatically added

### Step 5: Invite and Manage Azure AD Guest Users (B2B)

**Objective:** Demonstrate external collaboration using guest accounts.

**Steps:**

1. Microsoft Entra ID → Users → New user → Invite external user
2. Enter a valid external email address
3. Send the invitation
4. Assign the guest user to a security group

**Expected Result:**

* Guest user appears with **User Type: Guest**

## Validation Checklist

* [ ] Entra ID tenant verified or created
* [ ] Internal users created and configured
* [ ] Assigned security group created
* [ ] Dynamic security group created and validated
* [ ] Guest user invited and managed

---

## Security & Best Practices Applied

* Use groups instead of direct user permissions
* Follow the principle of least privilege
* Separate administrative and standard users
* Use dynamic groups for scalable access control

---

## Lessons Learned

* Dynamic group membership depends on accurate user attributes
* Guest users have limited permissions by default
* Tenant context switching can cause configuration confusion

---

## Next Project (Intermediate Level Preview)

* Assign Azure RBAC roles to Entra ID groups
* Manage permissions at subscription and resource group scopes
* Integrate Entra ID identities with Azure resources
